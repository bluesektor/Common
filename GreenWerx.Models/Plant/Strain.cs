        //        Genetics--Terpene Profiles--
        //
        //        System is designed to analyze, characterize and codify the subtleties in terpene differences across a large number of separate genetic groups(as per the color coded system), different populations within those groups, and time series analysis tracking where applicable(i.e.: terpene ratio and/or quantity variation during final weeks of flower development). Individuals will be grouped into different color groups based initially on some qualitative characteristics such as `nose` (piney, fruity, etc.), and later quantitatively.Quantitative analysis will allow for each individual to be profiled into the database.
        // Chemotype Profiles--
        // These can have the same framework as the terpene program, but can include cannabinoids and other secondary metabolites of interest.
        // Bioinformatics--
        // The use of evolutionary algorithms to run computer models of mass breeding programs that can allow for increased efficiency in parent material selection as well as accurately estimating required population sizes for field trials.
        //   phenotype I, II, or IV plants that are high in THC, CBD, and/or CBG
